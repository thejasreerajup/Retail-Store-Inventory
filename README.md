# Retail-Store-Inventory

## Introduction

The **Retail Store Inventory Management System** is a Python-based project designed to manage and analyze inventory data of a retail store efficiently. It helps store managers track product details such as **product name, category, price, stock quantity, and sales** in an organized manner.

Managing inventory manually can lead to issues such as **over-stocking, under-stocking, and data inconsistency**. This project simplifies inventory handling by using **Python and Pandas** for structured data storage and analysis.

The system provides a clear view of inventory status and supports better decision-making for maintaining optimal stock levels.
